h1. Vector Redraw of Sita Sings the Blues characters by Fabricio Zuardi

h2. About Sita Sings the Blues

"Sita Sings the Blues":http://sitasingstheblues.com is an animated 
feature film created by "Nina Paley":http://www.ninapaley.com/ .

It is a wonderful movie based on the ancient Ramayana,
it was released under a Creative Commons Share-Alike License and 
is available online, so if you still haven't seen it, stop everything 
and go there watch it!

h2. Why Redraw the characters?

* SVG is a great open format, and the movie has awesome drawings, so a perfect match
* At the moment of this writing, the Flash files "were not yet available":http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ
* Trace bitmaps are sub-optimal
* I wanted clean and human-readable SVG files (view source is your friend)
* I wanted to train my "Inkscape":http://inkscape.org skills ;)

h2. License

Since the movie uses a "Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
license, I was able to do my redraw of Nina’s work without having to ask her for permission
because she already granted permission for everyone to modify her work and release copies 
of derivative works like this, as long as they use the same license.

So, all vector drawings on this package, as well as the color palettes are
released under the same license: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
which means that you are free to use them for any purpose as long as you credit me
as the author of the redraw and Nina as the original artist creator of the drawings.

h2. Source

The vectors on this package used the "high quality Sita Sings the Blues Stills":http://www.archive.org/details/SitaStills
released by Nina on Archive.org as guide and basis for the redrawing.

h2. Contents

Each drawing has 3 files: an inkscape svg file, a plain svg file and an inkscape color palette you can throw 
in the "palettes" folder of your Inkscape to enable a new Color Swatch to use when editing that file.

h2. Updates and Contributions

We keep track of the changes and updates to this package at http://github.com/fczuardi/sita
under the folder "vectors", this is a GIT repository, which means that you can
pull recent changes to your machine, subscribe to the github RSS notifications to 
know when new files or updates are submitted, fork the whole project and suggest
fixes, submit patches or request pulls. I would love to see this collection grow with
the help of more people, please contribute :)

h2. Thanks

I wanted to thank once again Nina Paley for sharing her work, and you for downloading it.

Enjoy!
